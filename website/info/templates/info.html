            <h2>Discovery of Tea</h2>
            <p>
                Tea is believed to have been discovered in ancient China. According to legend, the Chinese Emperor Shennong discovered tea around 2737 BCE. Shennong was known as the "Divine Farmer" and was also credited with the discovery of many other medicinal herbs.

                The story goes that while Shennong was boiling water under a tree, some tea leaves fell into his pot. Intrigued by the pleasant aroma and taste of the infused water, he began experimenting with different types of tea leaves and their effects on the human body.

                From these humble beginnings, tea cultivation and consumption spread throughout China and later to other parts of the world. Today, tea is one of the most widely consumed beverages globally, with a rich cultural history and numerous health benefits.
